“The history of harmony is the history of the development of the human ear, which has gradually assimilated,
in their natural order, the successive intervals of the harmonic series” -Nadia Boulanger

The harmonic overtone series is the basis of all tonal music and the foundation of our understanding of Western music.
It is present in nature and through man-made sounds, from chirping to blasting fire alarms.
To better understand our instruments we must understand the harmonic series.
Based on the natural harmonic overtone series, just intonation is required to tune double stops and chords so that
the instrument rings with all the overtones lined up according to the overtone series. Harmonicello is a practice tool
for cellists and string players to learn how to use the harmonic series to play with improved just intonation.

The Harmonicello web app maps the first eight partials of the harmonic sequence on a visual representation
of the instrument's strings. The user will be able to click and sustain the sound of multiple partials at a time
making it possible to hear the sustained pitch while practicing the instrument.

Harmonicello is customizable and will have the ability to change the overall hertz and fundamental pitch of each string
to allow musicians of other stringed instruments to use the app. Harmonicello will also have the ability to toggle
among waveforms such as a sine wave, square wave, triangle wave, and sawtooth wave transforming harmonicello
from a practice tool to a fun online synthesizer. Users will have the ability to save their preset to access
again, spending less time configuring and more time playing.

Harmonicello uses Javascript, HTML, CSS, Web Audio API, and the Web Storage API.
